I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didnt have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now Im insecure and I care what people think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from?
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it never sell out of it Id probably only sell one
Itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose same clothes
Home grown the stones throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes
We all would take the ladder
Used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Singing wake up you need to make money yeah
