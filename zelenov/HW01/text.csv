From the coast of Westfall To Black Fathom Deeps Silent I will hunt you Silent I will creep
Gliding through the depths Gliding to your death Upon the shore I rise Hold my flippers to the skies
I am more than a fish I am more than a man Death will rise from the tide I am Murloc!
I am king of the sea But I am not Aquaman
Death will rise Hear our cry RwlRwlRwlRwl I am Murloc!
Hunter of the tides I will end your life Mourn your fallen brave Sleep in a sunken grave
Feel the deadly fin My nets drag you in
Bloodstained sand and gore All that is left upon the shore RwlRwlRwlRwl RwlRwlRwlRwl
Empty eyes never blinking Armored scales but never sinking Puddle jumper, the Coastal Runner Call me the Tide Hunter 
Raise your flippers to the sky! RwlRwlRwlRwl RwlRwlRwlRwl
