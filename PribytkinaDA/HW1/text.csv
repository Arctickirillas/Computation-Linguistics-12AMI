Among the blind the one-eyed man is king;
A bad beginning makes a bad ending;
A shy cat makes a proud mouse;
Every dog has his day;
A bad corn promise is better than a good lawsuit;
Care killed the cat;
A bad workman quarrels with his tools;
A cat in gloves catches no mice;
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush;
Every dog is a lion at home;
Time is money;
Wait for the cat to jump;
If things were to be done twice all would be wise;
The best fish swim near the bottom;
We never know the value of water till the well is dry;
An idle brain is the devil's workshop;
Every man is the architect of his own fortunes;
No man loves his fetters, be they made of gold;
Beware of a silent dog and still water;
Better a glorious death than a shameful life;
Every mother thinks her own gosling a swan
