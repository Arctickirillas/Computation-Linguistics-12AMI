Title;ArticleAmerica's 100 Most Trustworthy Companies;"As one-time corporate superpowers Enron and WorldCom collapsed like dominoes, James Kaplan grew tired of the routine spin on financial wrongdoing. Kaplan, director of proprietary ratings provider and investment adviser GMI Ratings, wanted to find a way to identify nefarious corporate behaviors and, at the same time, spotlight companies who abstained.The result was a ranking of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America.These were major financial disasters predicated on outright fraud, says Kaplan. I said, I think we can differentiate between companies that may be fraudulent but not yet discovered, and those companies that show governance and accounting transparency.Each year, GMI Ratings provides Forbes with a list of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America. To develop the ranking, GMI reviews the accounting and governance behaviors of more than 8,000 publicly-traded companies in North America. In assessing each company, GMI considers factors including high risk events, revenue and expense recognition methods, SEC actions, and bankruptcy risk as indicators of a companys credibility."Why Every Man Should Invest in a Great Bag;"Ask any trusted woman in your life and shell confirm this universal style truth: Its all about the bag.Whether its a briefcase or backpack, dont think of your bag as merely a functional carryall that totes your essentials around town.

"How to Properly De-Ice Your Home;"Winter storms bring more than snow: they also cover your home, driveway, and walkways with dangerous ice that youll need to remove, safely. Things can get a little confusing though, with all the different ice melting sprays, liquids, and sprinkles. Here are the best products and methods for keeping your home ice-free this winter.How to Obsessively Track This Weekend's SnowstormTheres a huge snowstorm bearing down on the Eastern half and Northern parts of the United States,Read moreBuy the Right Ice Melting Product for Your Driveway and WalkwaysWhen it comes to ice melt, you have more options besides plain rock salt. Some products work better in lower temperatures, while others can be damaging to the environment or harm the pets and plants around your home. Here are your best options:Calcium Chloride: It starts working fast, and its effective at sub-zero temperatures. Unfortunately, Calcium Chloride can damage plants and grass. Itll cost you around $10-$19 per 50-lb. bag.Calcium Magnesium Acetate: Its environmentally friendly and wont damage grass or plants, but it isnt as effective at temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Calcium Magnesium Acetate can also potentially damage concrete. Itll cost you $20 or more per 50-lb. bag.Magnesium Chloride: Its environmentally friendly and safe around plants if its not over-applied, and it works well sub-zero temperatures. If youre not careful, however, Magnesium Chloride is also lethal to pets that suffer from kidney disease if ingested. Itll cost you around $10-$19 per 50-lb. bag.Potassium Chloride: Its environmentally friendly and safe around plants if its not over-applied, but it isnt very effective at temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit, and its lethal to pets that suffer from kidney disease if ingested. Itll cost you $20 or more per 50-lb. bag.Standard rock salt (aka sodium chloride) is cheap and fairly effective, but it has plenty of downsides, too. Rock salt doesnt work as well as its alternatives at low temperatures, it can damage asphalt, concrete, brick, stone, metal, grass, plants, and wood (so just about every surface you might use it on), and it can be lethal to your pets if they ingest too much of it."Google's New Weather Card Has More Information Than You'll Ever Need;"Android: Searching for weather on your phone has always been a quick way to find out how cold it is outside.

[The Next Web]"Black And Blue Buffett: Berkshire Down More Than $1 Billion On American Express;"Is your stock portfolio suffering from a January chill? Take heart that youre in good company. For Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B +% the first month of 2016 has been like an avalanche.The latest blow came Friday, when American Express AXP -14.81% dropped almost 12% after the financial firm issued a disappointing outlook along with its fourth-quarter results. The fall knocked more than $7.5 billion from the companys market cap and hit its largest shareholder nearly as hard.Berkshire, which controls nearly 152 million American Express shares, saw the value of its 15% stake fall by nearly $1.2 billion Friday as shares dropped from Thursdays closing price of $62.64 to $55.00.(Paul Morigi/Getty Images)Unfortunately for Berkshires chief investor Buffett, that slide was just the most severe of a shaky start to earnings season for the biggest holdings in the firms portfolio.Wells Fargo WFC +0.00%, which issued fourth-quarter results last week, and IBM IBM +0.00%, which posted numbers Tuesday, have each fallen since reporting. Berkshires stake in Wells Fargo has been cut by more than $800 million and its IBM position is worth $475 million less than it was to start the week."For David Bowie And Glenn Frey, Different Paths Loom For A Rich Afterlife;"Look up here, Im in heaven, sings David Bowie in Lazarus, a song released just days before his untimely death last week. Then, a few lines later: Dropped my cell phone down below, aint that just like me?If Bowie means beaming art down to Earth from another realm, it sure is. During his half-century-plus career, the U.K native has inhabited his share of otherworldly charactersfrom Ziggy Stardust (a rock star capable of communicating with extraterrestrials) in his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars to Thomas Jerome Newton (an alien who comes to Earth to take water back to his home planet) in the 1976 film The Man Who Fell To Earth.Compare Bowies career arc to that of Eagles cofounder Glenn Frey, who passed away just days later, and its hard to find commonalities aside from their rock star status. In sharp contrast to Bowies avant garde genre bending, the Detroit-born Frey was known for singing and co-writing mellow California rock songs like Take it Easy and Tequila Sunrise. Bowie didnt tour over the past decade; the Eagles did so in epic fashion, earning $173.5 million in the last two years alone.The lives of Bowie and Frey will be forever linked due to geographical proximity (both passed away in New York) and the short span of time between their respective deaths, but their paths to a rich afterlife appear to be as different as their mortal careers. Of course, postmortem success includes its own unique set of challenges.This is heart and soul and poetry, says Jeff Jampol, whose company Jampol Artist Management handles the business of late musicians including Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and the Ramones. Its not a product. It has to be respected. Its what I call the Hippocratic Oath of Rock, which is: First, do no harm."The NHL's Highest-Paid Players 2015-16;"There are usually outliers among the top-paid players in every sport where the contract doesnt match the production. Brooklyn Nets small forward Joe Johnson has the second highest salary in the NBA this season at $24.9 million. Only three MLB players made more this season than first baseman Ryan Howard, who was paid $25 million by the Philadelphia Phillies. The total value of the contract for Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler is higher than any other NFL player at $126.7 million.But NHL general managers have chosen wisely recently when rewarding the richest deals to elite players. There are half a dozen NHL players with eight-figure salaries during the 2015-2016 season and each ranks among the top players at their position.When tracking the highest-paid players, Forbes considers salaries, as well as off-ice income from endorsements, licensing, memorabilia and appearances. We looked at 2015-16 NHL salaries and estimates for endorsements based on conversations with industry insiders.Sidney Crosby has earned $125 million in salary and endorsements during his decade in the NHL. (Photo: Derek Leung/Getty Images)The top-earning NHL player is Sidney Crosby at $16.5 million, including $4.5 million off the ice. The Pittsburgh Penguins center remains the NHLs most marketable player with endorsement deals with Gatorade , Rogers Communications , CCM, Tim Hortons, Upper Deck, Verizon and Frameworth for memorabilia. Sid the Kid signed a deal in October with Adidas worth more than $1 million annually. The two-time MVP was previously aligned with Reebok since entering the NHL as the No. 1 overall draft choice in 2005."LeBron James Tops The NBA's Highest-Paid Players 2016;"NBA players are gearing up to do battle with the leagues owners this year ahead of the December 15 deadline for either side to opt-out of the collective bargaining agreement signed in 2011. The players argue that average salaries have barely budged, while team profits soared and franchise values tripled thanks to reduced player costs and $24 billion in new TV contracts with TNT and ABC/ESPN . Management sees a rising tide lifting all boats with the $5+ million average salary already the highest in sports and heading north of $8 million when the cap rises with the new TV deals.Without question the top of the NBA food chain is flourishing thanks to maximum-level salaries and rich endorsement deals as companies clamor to get a piece of the U.S. sports league with the best global outlook. The NBAs 10 highest-paid players will bank $391 million from salaries and endorsements this season with 46% of the total earned off the court.Leading the way for the second straight year is four-time NBA MVP Lebron James at $71 million. James salary with the Cleveland Cavaliers is $23 million, third highest in the league. James opted out of his two-year Cavs contract last summer and signed another two-year year deal at a higher rate that again allows him to opt-out after the first year. It is a way to maximize his salary and take advantage of the rising salary cap."The 5 Biggest Problems With 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens';"Star Wars: The Force Awakens crashed into theaters this past weekend like a force-choke out of hell, crushing most sales records as surely as the Empire crushed the rebel scum on Alderaan.By all accounts, the film is exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. A remarkable cinematic success on its own merits, and a glowing affirmation of Disneys 2012 purchase of LucasFilm for $4 billion and change.I loved the film, as did my family and everyone Ive spoken with whos seen it so far. But that doesnt mean its perfect.Below Ill lay out the five biggest problems with Episode VII in all their gory detail.Some spoilers follow.Luke's Lightsaber1. The Force Awakens needed more dry politics and exposition.If theres one thing Im sad about when it comes to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, its the missing talk of trade negotiations, Senatorial politics, and various moments of dry exposition.Recommended by ForbesOracleVoice: The Public-Private Cloud Disconnect: Where Do We Go From Here?5 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Video Games That Need To Be MadeSAPVoice: 4 Reasons Finance Executives Are Primed For The FutureSyfy's New Space Opera 'The Expanse' Gets Off To A Terrific StartThe 5 Biggest Problems With 'Fallout 4''Gravity Falls' Is Ending After Just Two SeasonsMOST POPULAR Photos: The Richest Person In Every StateTrump Leads Cruz By 32 Points Nationwide In A New Zogby PollMOST POPULAR Photos: 2016 30 Under 30: MediaIndeed, The Force Awakens moved between fun action scenes, humorous moments, and terrible tragedy so quickly, there was almost no time for the sort of inter-galactic politicking that made the prequel trilogy so memorable and impersonal.Surely a speech or two in the Republic Senate could have helped with this, or some silly political pawns, and a Trade Federation or two for Snoke to manipulate from behind the scenes. Id even take a more in-depth explanation of what the science behind the Force actually is via Kylo Ren. For shame, J.J. Abrams!"
