"Wait for me, and I’ll be back,Should you wait me strong.Wait for me when sky is black And the sun has gone, Wait for me when it is cold, And when it is hot, Wait for me when others don’t, Cause they just forgot. Wait in case you don’t receive Letters from the front, Wait, and I will outlive, If you really want; Wait for me, and I’ll be back. Don’t you talk to those Gluing me a dead man tag. That’s a wrong suppose; Let my relatives believe That I am the past, Let my friends forget and give Funeral repast. They will drink a glass of wine For the peace of soul… You just wait and don’t make time, Do not raise the bowl; Wait for me, and I’ll be back, Disregard the fate, In the morning with my bag, Should you only wait; They will hardly understand, How I could survive. Waiting me from foreign land, You have saved my life; Let them say that it’s too late. What you feeling tells? I’ll be back, because you wait Like nobody else;"
